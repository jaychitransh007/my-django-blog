# Creating a separate application inside the project
python manage.py startapp blog


# After creating an application, we also need to tell Django that it should use it.
# We do that in the file mysite/settings.py -- open it in your code editor.
# We need to find INSTALLED_APPS and add a line containing 'blog.apps.BlogConfig', just above ]. So the final product should look like this:

# First we have to make Django know that we have some changes in our model. (We have just created it!)
python manage.py makemigrations blog


# Django prepared a migration file for us that we now have to apply to our database.
python manage.py migrate blog

# /admin screen
# Create Super User
python manage.py createsuperuser
